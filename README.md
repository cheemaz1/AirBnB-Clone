# Technologies 

Starting with the backend, I used Ruby on Rails along with  PostGresQL DB, jBuilder DSL to sculpt and limit the json sent up to the frontend. I used React and Redux to deliver the user interface and manage state respectively on the frontend. Google Maps API was used for marking locations. 


# Challenges Met 

Search By Location 
A lot of problems I encountered occured were while creating the search bar and search function. None of the homes were displaying when searching for a particular location. 

# Future Implementations 

* More homes will be added to the database 
* Users will be able to add new homes 
* Users will be able to send reviews for homes 
* Map markers will become more accurate
